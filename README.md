## Server Code

## Project Description
Our project is a casino webapp that features a currency system, 3 games, fake shop, and a backend that connects our users through a leaderboard.

## Tech Stack
We used a Springboot package to help construct the backend, while we wrote our games in Javascript, our pages in HTML, and stylized those pages with CSS. We ended up hosting on python aswell.

## Planning
We started by constructing our idea for a Minimum Viable Product. This product would feature, in order of priority, a single game, a currency to spend playing it, and a server to track different players currencies. 

We thought that this was a smart structure because any extra time could easily be spent expanding upon those systems with new games and places to spend coins.
