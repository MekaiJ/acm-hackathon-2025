## Server Code

## Project Description
Our project is a casino webapp that features a currency system, 3 games, fake shop, and a backend that connects our users through a leaderboard.

## Tech Stack
We used a Springboot package to help construct the backend, while we wrote our games in Javascript, our pages in HTML, and stylized those pages with C#. We ended up hosting on python aswell.

## Planning
We started by constructing our idea for a Minimum Viable Product. This product would feature, in order of priority, a single game, a currency to spend playing it, and a server to track different players currencies. 

We thought that this was a smart structure because any extra time could easily be spent expanding upon those systems with new games and places to spend coins.
